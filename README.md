TODO:
- scss 
- tests
- would be cool to have api with thumbs and even alpha color options, optimize loading

**Main requirements:**

- Each image should display the author’s name next to it.
- All photos should be fetched and displayed in a single, scrollable container.
- *(Nice to have)* Display photos as tiles, preserving their aspect ratio.

Use your own judgment to make the gallery responsive, performant, and user-friendly.  
When you’re finished, make sure your StackBlitz project is publicly accessible and send us the link (destination to be determined).
